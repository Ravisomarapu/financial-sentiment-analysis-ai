# Financial Sentiment Analysis using AI for APT Decisioning

## Reference Implementation Repository

This repository provides a **reference (reproducible) implementation** of the methodology described in the MSc thesis:

**“Fortified Financial Sentiment Analysis Using AI for APT Decisioning”**  
Ravi Somarapu – Masters in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence

## Scope and Intent

- This repository contains a **reference implementation**, reconstructed from the thesis methodology.
- It demonstrates **how** the experiments were conducted (pipeline, models, evaluation), not an exact reproduction of the original experimental environment.
- Numerical results may vary due to dataset reconstruction, randomness, and library versions.

This approach is standard and acceptable for MSc-level research and supports transparency and reproducibility.
